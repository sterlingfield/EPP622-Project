That looks pretty hairy, so I then just decided to look at proteins that are in both of my samples:

My sample that had EGTA did not have any of the same proteins as those from a previous experiment (AL), 
which makes sense becouse they used calcium in their buffer.

My calcium sample did have some over lapping proteins with those from a previous experiment
